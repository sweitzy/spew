Changes since 1.0.7

* Fixed a build issue with Debian. The basename function is available on
  new releases.

* Fixed a problem with with reusing the same random seed for every 
  iteration.  New seed is now used for every iteration.

Changes since 1.0.6

* Fixed a bug where the IOPS counter was not being reset between iterations 
  resulting in IOPS increasing after every interation.

* Fixed gcc 4.2 and 4.3 compile problems

* Spew no longer truncates the file when using the -o|--offset option.

Changes since 1.0.5

* Ported to IA-64 HP-UX.

* Joe Eiler contributed a patch that adds new patterns -- ones, zeros, alt, and
user defined. These patterns are all variations of the zeros
pattern, but instead 0's, 1's, 0xaa's, or any number between 0 and 255
are used in the buffer.

* Fixed build problems with GNU/kFreeBSD, which is Debian with a
  FreeBSD kernel.

* Fixed the following bugs:

  Not all data integrity errors were being logged (They were still
  being detected, just details were not included in the logfile).

  When using the -c|continue-after-error option, all subsequent
  transfers after the initial error were reported as errors when using
  the -P|--progress option.

  Offset into file for reported errors was added twice.

  Data range for integrity errors was reported in the log twice.

  Transfers with data integrity errors were not added to the total
  data transferred, resulting in attempted reads past the end of file.

Changes since 1.0.4

* Fixed bug in calculating read IOPS.

* Fixed double-counting bug when calculating intermediate statistics
  (used with --progress option).

Changes since 1.0.3

* Renamed the executable "snarf" to "gorge" to prevent a naming conflict with 
  the Snarf project (http://www.xach.com/snarf/).

* Fixed various Debian packaging problems.

* Command-line options can now be put in rcfiles.
  Added an --rc-file option to specify a rcfile on the command-line.
  Added an --no-rcfiles option to prevent the reading of standard rcfiles.

* I/O's per second (IOPS) statistics are now output to the console and
  to the logfile. 

* Issue better error messages when command-line options are used incorrectly.

* Fixed static builds for HP-UX 11.

Changes since 1.0.2

* Changed license from Hewlett-Packard proprietary to GPL.  Kudos to 
  Hewlett-Packard for agreeing to open source this project.

* Don't need to do an initial seek (with the --offset option), since offsets
  are contained in each transfer.  This fixes a bug when writing to
  tape drives where seeks are illegal.

Changes since 1.0.1

* Added an FAQ.

* Alphabetically sorted options and parameters in usage and man-pages.

* Added a PATTERNS section to the man-page.  This section will describe the 
  the various algorithms used for the --pattern option.

* Can now use the tebibytes(t) and terabytes(T) units for
  the --min-block-size, --max-block-size, --offset options and the the
  FILE_SIZE parameter.

* I/O error messages are sent to the log file as well as the screen.

* Read and write under-run are no longer treated as errors.  Under-runs
  are now logged instead.


Changes since 1.0.0

* Fixed a segmentation fault when using random block sizes with the --progress
  option.

* Fixed a memory leak that occurs when --iterations is 0 or greater
  than 1.

* Updated the documentation.
